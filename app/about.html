			<b>Jonathan Kershaw</b>
			<p>
				Jonathan is a guitarist/songwriter originally from Yorkshire in northern England but now
				 based on the south coast. Although known in various areas for his rock playing, he has quietly 
				 been applying his talents to an altogether different sound.
			</p> 
				 
			<p>
				His debut album “Bizarre Tales” (released in 2012) is a serene blend of strong, traditional Celtic 
				and folk sounds together with classical and rock influences. Although some of his material could 
				be related to the folkier moments of rock giants such as Led Zeppelin, Rush or Jethro Tull, this 
				does not fully quantify the complete spectrum of his sound. Intertwining guitar parts maintain a 
				curiously ethereal feeling of mysticism with pieces that move through a variety of emotions. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				 Of his live show, Jonathan had this to say, "The live shows are often an intimate affair – especially
				 if I’m playing solo or duet. I like to try and keep the crowd involved. The stage can be a lonely 
				 place when you’re up by yourself and as much of the ‘Bizarre Tales’ album is instrumental, I think 
				 it’s important to still try and engage listeners vocally. So we try and have fun with call-backs and 
				 some light-hearted banter. Normally we end up with laughs and good vibes….normally! I also like to 
				 try and use lights and visuals to add to the experience..."
			</p>
			<b>Beck Siàn</b>
			<p>
				Beck came to the UK from Australia in 2006. After three years of touring solo and sharing concerts 
				with Keith Potger (The Seekers), Julie Felix, Sheila Chandra, The Strawbs and Kathryn Roberts &amp; Sean 
				Lakeman and performing in venues as diverse as castles, abbeys, pubs, theatres, festivals and folk clubs, 
				Beck intended to return to Australia. She took some time away from the live gigs to record two albums in 
				Shropshire and mid Wales but has remained in the UK, in order to continue her live work.
			</p> 
				 
			<p>
				Beck’s music has been described as “Ethereal Ghost-Folk”, with a tendency towards the darker, supernatural 
				ballads and nostalgic songs of love and loss, whether performing her original compositions or stirring 
				interpretations of traditional and Celtic songs. Perhaps surprisingly (although not once you know she’s 
				a Celtic-Aussie and is part Welsh and part Irish :-), she also has a wicked and vibrant sense of humour 
				and develops a wonderful rapport with her listeners.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				 Her voice, which has been described by many top musicians as simply astonishing, bears some resemblence to
				 her famed cousin, Kate Bush (and Beck often credits Kate as being a terrific influence for her through he career). 
				 However Beck has found her own voice, moving divinely between heartbreakingly wistful 
				 and an incredible soprano, she creates the perfect atmosphere to suit the ghostly, dark tales of her songs.
