During the 1970s they defined the genre of what is now generically known as Heavy Metal. The sound was orchestrated by guitarist Tony Iommi with a Hell-nullifying bass line provided by Terry "Geezer" Butler. Bill Ward provided the cacophonic drum line and the crowning glory was introduced by the despairing cries of vocalist John "Ozzy" Osbourne. Their songs lay heavily in despondency and despair, yet, despite the doom-laden riffery, incited a strength and hope that has held countless for over three-and-a-half decades. Bands from <EM>Metallica</EM> and <EM>Nirvana</EM> to <EM>Entombed</EM> and <EM>Morbid Angel</EM> have all credited Black Sabbath with being the inspiration behind their music&#8212;this is testament enough to the significance of the music that they created.<P><SPAN CLASS="sab">Sabbra Cadabra</SPAN> are one of Britain's leading Black Sabbath tribute bands and have brought fresh, young blood to re-live the original Sabbath performances.
