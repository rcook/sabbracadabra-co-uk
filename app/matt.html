In some respects it was always said that Matt faced the toughest challenge 
within <SPAN CLASS="sab">Sabbra Cadabra</SPAN>. The vocal sound of anytribute band can 
often be the critical factor in recreating the soundand feel of the originals and Ozzy 
must have one of the most distinctivevoices in music. Matt never ceased to surprise 
audiences (and theband!) by his reproduction of Ozzy in both sound and performance. 
Live,Matt's performance had to be seen to be believed. He had been known torush out of the
 venue into the centre of the town, scream, "BlackSabbath" and come haring back just in 
 time to add a few "woas" to theend of War Pigs! Musically, Matt had a mixed background 
 though(unbelievably) <SPAN CLASS="sab">Sabbra Cadabra</SPAN> was his firstmajor band. It was a 
 shame he couldn't continue with the Reunion gigs - his successor has large boots to fill....!
